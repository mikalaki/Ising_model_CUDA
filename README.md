#How tester Works
For test the programm's correctness , open folder /tester in a terminal.After :

       for test V0. sequential version execute in terminal "make test_sequential"
       for test V1. cuda version execute in terminal "make test_v1"
       for test V2. cuda version execute in terminal "make test_v2"
       for test V3. cuda version execute in terminal "make test_v3"
